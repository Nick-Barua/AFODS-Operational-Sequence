# Advanced Falling Object Detection System (AFODS) – Operational Sequence  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17460756.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17460756)

## Description  
This repository contains the operational-sequence diagram for the AFODS (Advanced Falling Object Detection System). It illustrates the five-stage data-processing pipeline combining multi-modal sensor fusion (LWIR, NIR, ultrasonic) with AI (YOLOv7-Tiny) for detection of falling or fallen humans to prevent vehicle collisions.
